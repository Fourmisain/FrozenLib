Hello
Put changelog in plain text please
Make sure to clear this after each release

Put changelog here:

-----------------
- Added config syncing
  - Configs will sync from server to client when joining a server, on datapack reload, and on use of `/frozenlib_config reload`
  - Configs will sync from client to server any time the client config is saved and the player has permission level 2 or greater
    - An example of this is saving a config via Cloth Config or other GUI
