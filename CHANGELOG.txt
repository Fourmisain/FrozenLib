Hello
Put changelog in plain text please
Make sure to clear this after each release

Put changelog here:
-----------------
- Fixed disk features causing crashes during worldgen (they can no longer access the world from multiple threads at the same time.)
- The Loot Table Whacker now displays error and success messages above the hotbar.
- Converted feature configurations to records.
- Added the Optimized Biome Tag Condition Source, allowing surface rules to utilize tags without causing lag.
    - Each time a server is loaded or a datapack is reloaded, all Optimized Biome Tag Condition Sources will iterate through the entries in their specified tag, and add them to a list.
    - This means that the previous iteration using tags no longer needs to iterate through the tag for every single block it checks, only needing to use a already-existing list, matching the performance of regular Biome Condition Sources.
- All path features now include a "chance" field in their configurations, denoting the chance for each block to place during generation.
- Cleaned up and improved some mixins.
- Some internal cleanup and annotation.
